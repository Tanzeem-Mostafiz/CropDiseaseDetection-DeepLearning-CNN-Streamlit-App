# ðŸŒ± AGROGUIDE â€“ Crop Disease Detection

**AGROGUIDE** is a web-based application developed as part of a **university course group project**.  
It uses **deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras)** and **computer vision** to detect crop diseases in real time from images or webcam feed. The application provides **disease identification**, **causal explanations**, and **practical cure suggestions** for multiple crops, aiming to support farmers and agricultural researchers.

## Project Overview

### Features
- Detect diseases in crops such as **Corn, Pepper, Potato, Tomato, and Cotton**.  
- Upload images or capture live images via webcam.  
- Provide **disease prediction**, **disease description**, and **actionable cure points**.  
- Real-time predictions with a clean, user-friendly **Streamlit interface**.  
- Pre-trained **deep learning model** trained on labeled crop images.

### Crops & Diseases Covered
- **Corn**: Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spot, Northern Leaf Blight  
- **Pepper (Bell)**: Bacterial Spot  
- **Potato**: Early Blight, Late Blight  
- **Tomato**: Late Blight, Yellow Leaf Curl Virus  
- **Cotton**: Bacterial Blight, Curl Virus, Fusarium Wilt
